🚗 Developed a Frogger Game in Python! 🐢

🕹️ To tell you the truth, I developed my own version of the classic Frogger game in Python using the Turtle library. In my case, the game features a turtle as the main character, instead of the traditional frog. The turtle needs to cross a busy street full of cars while avoiding collisions.

🚦 How it Works:

The player controls a turtle, represented by a drawing object, using the arrow keys to move it forward and cross the street.

Cars appear on the screen and move horizontally in the opposite direction to the turtle. The player must avoid colliding with the cars while crossing the street.

If the turtle successfully crosses, the level increases, and the cars become faster, increasing the challenge for the next attempt.

🏆 Implemented Features:

Upward movement functionality for the turtle.

Random generation of cars and horizontal movement of cars.

Collision detection between the turtle and the cars.

Score counting and difficulty increase as the turtle successfully crosses.

📚 Applied Python Concepts:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Loops and Conditionals

Handling Keyboard Events

Time Control

Collision Detection and Game Logic
